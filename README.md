# PronounDB.org Discord Bot

A Discord Bot that uses the PronounDB API to make people aware of other people's pronouns!

## How to use

Simply invite the bot by [clicking on this link](https://nurmarv.in/invite-pronoundb-bot). After that the bot will automatically assign the pronoun roles to people that have set them up on pronoundb.org whenever they join the server or type in chat. So, if you haven't already, [create an account on PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org/register) and set-up your pronouns! \
If you added the bot to a server that already has a lot of members and you want to sync them, you can run `pdb sync` and the bot will **try** to go through all members on the server and try to assign their pronoun role (no guarantees this will not break, my code is shit).

## How to contribute

Got something to improve on this shitty code? Feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/NurMarvin/pronoundb-bot/pulls) and I'll gladly take a look at significantly better code. Just as shit at coding as me? No worries, just [open an issue instead](https://github.com/NurMarvin/pronoundb-bot/issues/new) and I'll try to code it myself, but no guarantees it won't break.

## Disclaimer

This bot is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by the original creator of PronounDB, [Cynthia](https://github.com/cyyynthia/). I simply created this bot because I was bored and thought something like this would be pretty cool to have apart from the already existing [Powercord plugin](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb-powercord).
